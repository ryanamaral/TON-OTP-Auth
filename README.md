# TON OTP Auth

TON OTP Auth is a secure and user-friendly Telegram Mini App designed to manage one-time password (OTP) codes for multiple accounts. It leverages the TON blockchain to encrypt and store OTP entries within a custom NFT owned by the user. This decentralized approach ensures that authentication data remains private and tamper-proof, giving users full control over their security.


## Features

- **Secure OTP Management**: Add and manage OTP codes for multiple accounts in a single app.
- **NFT-Based Storage**: OTP data is encrypted and stored on the TON blockchain within a custom NFT, providing decentralized and tamper-proof data storage.
- **TON Connect 2**: Supports wallets that integrate with the Ton Connect 2 protocol.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Fully utilizes the TON blockchain for NFT generation and secure OTP storage.


## Prerequisites
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) installed on your device
- A TON wallet to manage NFTs (e.g. [Telegram Wallet](https://wallet.tg/), [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/))


## How It Works

1. **Set Up**: Users will open the _TON OTP Auth_ app within Telegram.
2. **Add Accounts**: Various accounts (e.g., Google, GitHub) can be added to the app.
3. **NFT Creation**: A custom NFT is generated on the TON blockchain to securely store the encrypted OTP data.
4. **Accessing OTPs**: Users can view and copy their OTP codes directly within the Telegram Mini App.
5. **Security**: All OTP entries are stored in an encrypted format within the NFT, ensuring privacy and security.
